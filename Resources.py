**This app is inspired by former APA president, Martin Seligman, and his book Learned Optimism. Learned optimism is the process of recognizing and challenging pessimistic thoughts in order to develop more positive behaviors.
Feel free to skim this page, the wiki or even buy the book to learn more about what learned optimism means.**

## Why should I be optimistic? ##

In a study completed by Martin Seligman and Gregory Buchanan at UPenn, learned optimism techniques were found to significantly reduce
depression in a class of college freshmen. As incoming students to the university, a survey determined the most
pessimistic students and they were invited to participate in the study. They were randomly assigned, half to attend
a 16-hour workshop on the techniques of learning optimism, and half were the control group. In an 18-month follow up,
32% of the control group suffered moderate to severe depression and 15% suffered moderate to severe anxiety disorder,
whereas only 22% of the workshop participants were depressed and 7% had anxiety issues. Those who participated in the
learned optimism workshop also reported fewer health problems over the 18-month period of the study than those students
in the control group

## What're the key differences between optimism and pessimism ##

Optimistic people tend to view good events as a result of their merit, as a sign of things to come and as a sign
of the world around them. On the flip side, they recognize bad events as temporary, not indicative of who they
are or the world around them.

In short they view good events as being personal, permanent and pervasive, whilst viewing bad events as
impersonal, impermanent and localized.

The graphic below shows a good example of optimistic vs pessimistic response to an event

## How do I know how optimistic/pessimistic I am? ##

The best way would be to take Martin Seligman's Learned Optimism questionnaire. It's also key
to recognize when you're personalizing and generalizing bad events.

## How do I get better? ##

By using the disputation technique!

Seligman's process of learning optimism consists of a simple method to train a new way of responding to adversity, specifically, by learning to talk themselves through personal defeat. It begins with the Ellis ABC model of adversity, belief, and consequence.

Adversity is the event that happens, Belief is how that adversity is interpreted, and Consequences are the feelings and actions that result from the beliefs. This is demonstrated in the example below:

Adversity: Someone cuts you off in traffic.

Belief: You think, "I can't believe that idiot was so rude and selfish!"

Consequence: You are overcome with anger, yelling profanity at the other driver.

First, make a log of these ABCs for a day or two.

Then in reflection, add "D" (disputation) and E (energization). Disputation centers on generating counter-evidence to any of the following: the negative beliefs in general, the causes of the event, or the implications. D also means reminding oneself of any potential usefulness of moving on from the adversity. 

Disputation for the above traffic example might sound like this: "I am overreacting. I don't know what situation he is in. Maybe he is on his way to his daughter's piano recital and is running late. I'm sure I have cut people off before without meaning to, so I should really cut him a break. I am not in a hurry anyway."

Over time, responses like this are predicted to change feelings to be more hopeful and positive. Successful disputation leads to energization, the E in the ABCDE model. One is energized, and should indeed try to actively celebrate, the positive feelings and sense of accomplishment that come from successful disputation of negative beliefs. Disputation and Energization (celebration) are the keys to Seligman's method.
