0,"Several days ago I had a stressful day at work. This was caused by the laundry list of assignments I was given and because I was stressed out about an issue with my last employer.

I work for a carpenter. I was instructed to clean up the backyard of a house that's under construction. There were about 100 heavy duty bags filled to the brim with probably bowling balls. Really though, they were filled with tile flooring and a lot of wood with nails still in them. I'd carry these bags one by one to the dumpster. Hauling them over my head was almost impossible. And the nails would poke through the bags and they would hurt my back and head. This was not my only assignment for the day, so I had to run around and make sure the others were done, as they had to be completed by the end of the day. I had only completed half of the garbage disposal before I left for work, only to continue with this task the next day.

The issue with my old employer gets me angier each day that passes. He's owed me my last paycheck for about six weeks. And he's been ignoring me for the last month. The bad feelings I had from everything I delt with were exasperated by a migraine that had lasted a few days. I want to sustain a work related injury so that I can take some time off.",1
1,"It's the end of my day off. I can't say that it was productive, but I definitely can't complain. I didn't read like I planned to, but I'd say that I got some well deserved time off, so that's okay. Maybe I should've eaten healthier, but at least I'm not hungry. I had sandwiches for all three meals today. Salami sandwiches with provolone, lettuce and extra mayo. Not the healthiest, but they were delicious. I'd liked to have accomplished more but I understand why I lazed around today. And I'm fine with that. There is always tomorrow at lunch to read a little. I just wish I had more energy and will power on the weekends.",5
2,"Today was great. My girlfriend and I have been looking for a place to live together for a while. We were able to find an affordable condo that isn't too far from where we currently live and work. We won't be far from family or friends. I have some reservations because there are other buyers trying to move into the same place. However, this would be a dream home, so I still can't help but feel excited. I love my girlfriend and I really want to live with her.",8
3,"I woke up having just worked yesterday until midnight because of all the tests I have to study for. And I'm just really tired and don't have the energy to go through more zoom meetings and then on top of that go back to doing work right afterwards. After this one meeting with a superior, I was so frustrated by how condescendingly they answered my questions. Their answer was to a question I didn't ask - a dumber, simpler version of that question, presupposing that I was missing basic knowledge to the task at hand. It also suggested that they weren't even really listening to my question to begin with. I really hate when people condescendingly speak down to others, especially in positions of power where it is so easy to do so. After all my meetings, I did work until bedtime again and just hope that all of this is worth something in the end.",3
4,"I finished all of my work at a decent time so that I could watch my favorite tv show afterwards and drink hot cocoa/put on a holiday-themed essential oil on my diffuser. It felt like Christmas time. I was so grateful to be in a program gaining interesting, directly applicable information in a field where I feel I will be respected and I feel will be rewarding, making an impact in others' lives. Growing up, I was very Catholic, very much because of my family's beliefs and upbringing. I lost that over time but recently have felt inspired to return to it. And I'm happy to realize I've chosen a career where my religious values directly apply - helping others while doing intellectually stimulating work and supporting myself as well. In that way, I feel that everything I do everyday is directly in line with my greater values, and purpose in life.",8
5,I woke up and did a light workout before getting dressed and reading a research article to practice my research literacy skills. Then I went to all my zoom meetings and classes and did work. I got to hangout with my siblings at some point after they finished their work and school days respectively and we also had coffee with my dad. I texted with my best friend who's currently in Connecticut. Then I watched tv and went to bed.,5
6,"I woke up early and had breakfast. I had a good amount of sleep and my head was feeling clear and energized. I drove to my home studio and prepared my recording session that would happen later that day. I also worked on editing the tracks for one of the bands I had recorded earlier this month. Before I knew it it was time to go to the other recording studio I work at. It was a little stressful because I didn't get the session sounding the way I wanted to before I had to leave. I had to rush out of the door to make it on time to the other studio. When I got there the owner was working but stopped as soon as I came. We had a good 2 hour conversation on how I was doing with my work and what I could be doing to get more clients. We talked about future plans and some personal things too. A little bit before the band that I was recording came in, the owner took a look at my session that I had previously prepared and helped me get it sounding the way I wanted it to. It took him under 15 minutes to make a few minor changes that made a huge difference on how the song sounded. I didn't realize it until I was driving home that night, but seeing him work on my song amazed me and inspired me. I was amazed how he knew exactly what to reach for to get the sound he wanted. It made me realize that I have so much to learn and gave me so much motivation to pursue my work. I don't know what it was but those simple 15 minutes had such a big impact on me. It felt unreal and seeing his greatness at work was incredible.",8
7,"Today I decided to sleep in and wake up later than I usually do. I had class at around 12pm. I woke up just in time for that. During class I showered, did my hair, and got dressed. I went out to get some breakfast for my girlfriend and I. I dropped off the food and drove to my home studio to do some work. I got there around 1:30. I ate and started to work. This was around 2:00pm. I was editing drums when suddenly I had the urge to play my drum set. I did that for about an hour. When I stopped I texted my band mates to see if we were having band practice today. One of my members informed us that his father's liver is failing and does not have a lot of time left to live so we decided not to practice. For some reason after that I started watching youtube videos, procrastinating. I didn't get back to work until 6:00pm. I felt bad for what happened. I finished editing drums around 8:00pm and started mixing one of the songs I recorded for a band. I worked on that until 10:00pm and drove home. I was upset that I procrastinated and knew that I could have gotten a lot more work done.",4
8,Today I had to wake up early because my dad asked me to come to his house. He needed me to watch the people that are working on the bathroom. I brought my laptop with me so I could get my school work done. I worked for a little bit but ended up on my phone. I watched videos on facebook as well as started browsing on reddit. I caught myself and went back to work. After my dad came home I went out with my girlfriend. The weather was nice so we decided to go to a park and walk around. We ended up doing that until it got dark. After that I came home and cooked dinner. We watched a movie and then I went to sleep.,5
9,"My situation feels never-ending. I knew things could get bad, but I never knew they'd get quite like this. Can they get worse still? We try to reassure ourselves that things will turn out okay, that we are doing all that we can. I try to assure myself that one day my environment and life will be peaceful again. 
There's a lot of toxicity all around. I had never witnessed such dysfunction first-hand as I have in these past few months. I try to meddle and mediate when I can. Pacify when the situation presents itself with both him and with her. But he is relentless. His memory fades and so no matter how much we beg and plead he will not change. She is intelligent and persuasive (or tries to be), but is in severe denial and pain. 
I feel exhausted. I tell my sister that everyday feels like ""Groundhog Day"". She agrees. I hate watching my family crumble around me as we try to support so many things which need supporting. A toxic relationship, extreme mental illness--which I thought only manifested itself in horror movies up until now, and a deteriorating memory. The funny thing is, the love is still there. It shines in the few happy moments that still exist. I hold onto glimpses of it with all my heart. But I know that it won't last and that in a matter of hours our hint of brightness will be drowned out again by the darkness.
I feel angry. I'm angry at their resistance. Angry that their personalities are so stubborn and selfish and nit-picking. This makes things infinitely harder. My parents are doers and fixers. I am a listener, a reflector. She listens to none of us. For a while I convinced myself that I could help to cure her anxious and depressive thoughts when they could not handle it anymore. After all, I studied some psychology in college. But the resistance I receive is unrelenting. She says she appreciates talking to me, but I know that's only because I dont challenge her thoughts much. I feel I am enabling. I don't know how to be in my own home. I'm tired of listening to the same thing over and over again, each day. I'm exhausted. I'm almost numb to it, but I still get nervous and anxious around all of it. When will it end? How will it end? I'm trying to push through but I feel like I am only surviving. I am not living anymore. None of us are. And that is terrifying. Life can get bad, of course. There are things that happen that we don't like. But so many heavy conversations, emotion management at 7:30am in the morning or when I'm barely out of a work Zoom call is really a lot. And there's no end in sight. 
I'm grateful to have my family for support. I think we all need it during these trying times. But, we are all still tired. It's been two months now, during the quarantine, with nowhere to just get away from it all for a while. I pray that this is over soon, so that peace can return. I want my family to come out of this together. I naively hope it will be soon, but deep down I know that's just not possible.

10,"Today was a better day. My mom, my sister, and I had to run an errand which took several hours, and it felt like such a relief to be back together again. I forget that we are in a pandemic sometimes in these moments, and I know that's what helps get me through something that's so uncertain! I appreciate the beautiful moments in life. I adore my mother and my sister. They are both so special and give me so much hope for the future.
In other news, I passed my certification exam! I've been waiting for these results forever and they finally came! I am ecstatic. I can proudly display my credentials and have this ""proof"" that I can put into practice what I am passionate about. This will open so many doors for my career and I am really glad that I was able to accomplish this.
I talked to John today. He's doing better and things are looking up. I love him so much. It's amazing to see where we were and how we've grown. He is my best friend and understands me completely.
Today was a better day for her, thankfully. We were finally able to have a nice conversation like old times. It felt special. I am always slightly nervous that things could turn for the worst, but thankfully they didn't today. Overall, I am proud of her. A good day means things are looking up. I really hope they are, although I am still wary. I have to be skeptical after what we've all been through these past months.
",8
11,"Today was good! Nothing major occurred, so it was nice to have some degree of peace. I went to work and met my deliverables. Work is going pretty good. I did not feel much like texting anyone so instead I browsed some videos. 
I did my coursework which is due soon. I feel slightly concerned about the deadlines but over all I know I will get it done at the end of the day. Even if the quality isn't spectacular. 
It's nice to not feel anxious or scared. I feel like no news is good news â€“ I'm going to take advantage of today as a break from everything. 
My dad took them out for the day. I hate to admit this, but it was such a relief. A feeling of calmness comforted me throughout the day. I felt relieved, free. Even if that feeling only lasted those several hours, it was still much needed. I await the day when I will feel this calmness all the time. Again, it sounds mean to say it but it's the truth. They say to put on your own oxygen mask before someone else's, right? And if no solution is coming anytime soon, I've got to take advantage of these moments.

12,2021 will be amazing. I am ready for a new year and a new change on the way I do things.  I hope that the coming year will bring an end to the pandemic and we can get back to a relatively normal life.  I am super excited to travel and see friends and family again.  I can't wait for the new year.,9
13,I woke up today and am hopeful about work. I have a feeling that I'm going to get a lot of jobs done online. That'll make me feel productive. After that I'll play some video games. If my day goes well enough with work I may even treat myself by buying a new game I've wanted. ,9
14,"In the year 2021, I plan to achieve a lot of my goals. In 2021, I will have more financial stability and make the amount of money that I need to survive and live. I will also practice more self love this new year. I will be successful in my school work and will earn my degree as planned. This year will be an amazing year for me and I will see that it happens no other way. ",9
15,"Today I just finished studying for my final. I've got to say, I'm feeling pretty good about the upcoming test. I thought the material would be a lot harder to study for but I reviewed a lot today. The test shouldn't be too hard according to my friends either. I think I can probably get around a 95 if everything goes according to plan! ",8
16,from the begging when i was a kid i love to climb trees houses and finces i was so hyper active. it was the bet times of my life and haveing a best friend to do it with. jeff was my bet friend my ride or die if i was in troble jeff was in troble. we learnd as little boys that when he got beat i got beat we did the same stuff togather that was one of the happy time of my life.,8
17,"I have had a wonderful day today, I woke up perfectly. I then went out to get a cup of delicious coffee, everything is going to be great. I have some important tasks to get done soon, hopefully they all go well. I still haven't heard back from some opportunities, I'm sure they are all good. Everything is wonderful",7
18,"I successfully passed my certification exam today! Though I was nervous and thought that I was underprepared, I passed with a decent score. It was nerve wreaking having the instructor watch me from the webcam, but I managed to push past it. I really hope that this certification will help me in my professional and personal life. Well, time to go and update my resume. ",8
19,"Yesterday I had a fun time with my friends. We ate from a board full of cheeses, bread, cracks, meats, and fruits. We paired it with wine and dressed fancily for the occasion. Everyone ate and drank a lot and we had a great time catching up.",9
20,"I didn't get any sleep last night. In fact, I stayed up. But I wasn't in a bad mood at all and I was able to postmates me some McDonalds for breakfast so I had a pretty tasty breakfast. I also had a good morning call with my significant other and they seemed to be in a good mood which in turn also put me in a good mood. I hope the rest of the day turns out to be a good one. ",8
21,I am newly sober and am hoping to continue that into the new year. I am optimistic about my future and my marriage as it heals from negative consequences of my actions. I am hopeful that all things will work out in the end and I will grow to be the person I was before the pandemic. It has been hard work but I am committed to pushing against the grain into a positive future.,9
22,Today I am going to be very productive and will achieve greatness. I'm going to have a great year in 2021 and will surpass my goals in ways I could never imagine. I am manifesting the best for myself. This will be the best year of my life and I will feel fulfilled beyond my wildest dreams.,10
23,"I'm really proud of the man I'm becoming for once. Sure, things are hard, sure I have some big choices to make and I feel lost sometimes, but at least I know I'm worthy and I am strong! I can get through anything with the right attitude and hard work.",9
24,"I feel motivated for the next time I take my board exam to become a Dietitian. There is a sense of hopefullness, I think I have a very good chance to tackle this exam and pass with flying colors. I then know I will be able to get a good job and finally be able to live on my own. I also will be finishing my Masters which will help me earn more money in the future. ",7
25,"2020 has been a very interesting and challenging year in many aspects. To some, all the changes may be sad as we struggle to adjust being away from our families and friends. I however, am looking at it as once in lifetime moment. It allows us to reconsider what is truly valuable in our lives.",9
26,Today is starting out to be a great day.  The sun is shining even though it is cold outside.  I woke up feeling refreshed this morning and got up to make coffee.  Then I went to work and had a good morning.  I hope the day continues to go well.,9
27,Im feeling good today and ended up getting along of things done. I went outside and the weather felt really good. I ended up meeting up with a friend from work and we went to the park. I ended the day by cooking myself a nice dinner. ,10
28,I think we are finally getting a handle on the pandemic as far as starting to inculcate the population goes. I am hopeful that it will really help in the next few months. I am glad the incoming administration seems to have a firmer grasp on how truly awful it has been for most of the population. I think things may get better soon.,9
29,"Yesterday I had a terrible night, but then I woke up today and everything was okay. I had a good breakfast, I accomplished some work, and I even laughed off how terrible the night was for me. I can't help but feel that for having such a terrible night it is just in my cards to have an amazing day.",9
30,"Well I think tomorrow is going to be a great day. I should be hearing positive things back from the job I applied for. The interview went really well and I think I nailed it. Here's to me and my new job, everything is looking up.",9
31,I am really excited about today. We are supposed to be getting a check in the mail and I know it will help us out of this rough patch. Even the air is crisp and happy. I love cozy days. ,9
32,Today is new years eve. I hope the coming year proves to be a blessing. I hope to accomplish much more this year and makeup for the lack of activity this year. ,6
33,I woke up this morning feeling sick. I can’t complain because I know there are so many people that are worse off than me. I will pray and ask that I might feel better. I’ve got this!,9
34,when one door closes another one opens. I can't wait to takeover the new year with success and an abundance of wealth. It WILL be my year.,10
35,"Today is New Year's eve. I am trying to warm up after sleeping the night in a 45-50 degree apartment, using my little space heater. I am theoretically working today, but my bosses are crazy to make us do this, and I finished up my work for the year. Today is my day to mentally and physically recover. I have planned a little party for myself, have lots of great food to eat (all healthy and delicious) and will ring in the New Year. Tomorrow is a new beginning, and I am taking the next three days to get my place and my life in order.",8
36,"Although my wife and I have been lucky not to be too affected by COVID thus far, it is starting to have an impact on our work and our life. We have worked remotely for years so did not need to make any adjustments to our routine at first. But recently, our main freelancing client (and our main source of income) said he needs to reduce the amount he is spending, so our hours have been cut. This has led to some serious uncertainty about how we will continue to make ends meet. Luckily, the client did us the favor of letting us know a month ahead of time that our hours will be reduced, giving us time to prepare. He is also helping us to find other clients through his network to replace the lost income. Time will tell whether we are able to make up the difference, but we feel lucky that he is being so proactive and helpful.",6
37,"It's raining today but it sounds really nice on the window. I was going to go for a run but that's okay, I can do some yoga and have some tea instead. I like to think that rainy days are the universe telling us to take a rest. I've been really emotionally tired lately, so now's a chance to take care of myself. I've also been beating myself up mentally, saying I'm not worth anything and thinking I'm a failure. Some days it feels true, but today I'm going to try to restructure that thinking and make today something really positive.",6
38,"I’m home again and have to get back to the grind of life. I’m going to try and get as much done before/after work as I can, so I can be done with little errands before school starts back up. Hopefully I’ll get it done even earlier than that so I can have some time to myself. If not, I don’t think the first weeks of school will be too stressful so that I can get it all done. I just hope that everything will go easy for my sake.",5
39,"Today was pretty much life as usual. I took care of Tilly for the majority of the day. We went grocery shopping and she slept the majority of the time. After getting home, I put Tilly to bed and cleaned the house. At least work and school weren't too busy.",7
40,"I didn't really get to do much in 2020. Because of COVID, I mostly stayed at home and spent time with family. I also didn't get to eat out as much, but I still got take-out every now and then. Overall, nothing exciting happened, but I'm glad none of my family members or myself got sick or had anything really bad happen.",6
41,"While this year hit many people hard, for me it has been mostly the same.  I have had no change in work and in fact, I like it better with the work from home.  The pandemic has been depressing, but honestly it has barely changed my daily life.  I think that this next year will be similar to the last and I do not mind it",6
42,Nothing has really been happening lately. With the pandemic I've just been going through the motions. I haven't really accomplished a lot with work or my goals but nothing bad has happened either. It's kind of like coasting through at the moment. It's doable but it could be better. ,5
43,"While I do hope that 2021 is one of the best years of my life, I will also take into account that things happen. I know that life has a lot of twists and turns that I cannot plan for but I know that I will be able to conquer them. Life is all about what you make it. Life may not also go your way, but you can make it the best for you. Either way my life goes, I will be thankful to see another day. ",8
44,"I just finished making some lunch. I made eggs with some sautéed vegetables on the side. Also prepared two slices of toast as well. Just took a bite, it tasted pretty good. It could use a bit more salt and pepper though. I wonder if I should start learning to cook more. It would be helpful for me in the future. ",6
45,i can be at work and if i see something i have nothing to do with i stay out of it. like a time when i saw two people get in to it and asked me a question i stayed out of it. i have learned to stay out of peoples way when things happen. like a time when i new two people close and i new somthing but i had to stay out of it.,5
46,"I woke up today. I then went out to get a cup of  coffee, everything is. I have some important tasks to get done soon. I still haven't heard back from some opportunities. Everything is going.",5
47,"Was an uneventful day today, just did my chores and relaxed for the majority of the time. Wish it wasn't so hot outside while I was mowing my lawn but I suppose it was good to get some sunlight. I really need to get a double bladed mower, I don't like that my current one leaves behind clumps of mulch everywhere. At least I had a  cold shower to look forward to after mowing. Just relaxing and watching TV after that was a good way to start the weekend. ",7
48,"Today, I am recovering from last night's party. I drank a lot of wine and need to replenish myself by drinking water and eating a lot of food. I have to clean my room because of all the things I cluttered while getting ready for the party. I will put on Harry Potter while that happens.",6
49,The day started alright. I definitely would like to get a little bit or rest due to not sleeping last night but I definitely could be feeling worse so I'm glad that isn't the case. I was also took a pretty interesting survey this morning so I would say that It's not all bad. ,4
50,Life is difficult and I am up to the challenge but am not overly optimistic or pessimistic in my goals. Time will tell if I am able to achieve this goal but I know that for a positive future I need to maintain my goals. There is no positive or negative outcome in the immediate future that will dictate where my life goes from here. I am just trying to maintain a neutral journey on the way to happiness as it comes with time.,6
51,The new year is coming and I will continue to stay on the path that I am on. I hope everything works out. I am anxious about what is to come but I think it will be okay. I am not expecting anything dramatic out of the coming months.,4
52,"I'm Ok but I guess I just kinda feel like I didn't get much done today. It's fine though, not everyone is completely productive every single day.",5
53,The world today is going through a lot and my plans have been side tracked. I think everything will be okay and this will all be over eventually though. Today was good as I studied and cleaned the house. I was productive today which made me happy. This virus has made everything very difficult. ,4
54,"Christmas has just happened and it was a different holiday this year. Due to circumstances, families were not able to get together as normal and if they did, had to social distance and wear masks. Next Christmas should be different as the vaccine rollout continues.",6
55,"I don't have much to do this afternoon but that isn't a big deal.  I'll probably do some laundry after I have lunch.  My apartment could use some cleaning too. Overall, it's not bad to have a slow afternoon.",5
56,I had an ok day today. I ended up working all day and managed to spend some time outside but the weather was not the best. I also got to watch my favorite show later on in the evening. I made myself dinner but I ended up burning it a little but it tasted ok.,5
57,We are at a crossroads regarding the pandemic. Things could het better. Things could get worse. It could possibly just stay the same for awhile.,5
58,"A cold front hit yesterday and we are on the lake. I don't mind the rain outside too much because it makes for a beautiful view but it could be a bit sunnier. Nobody is awake before 12 unless they are working and I typically wake up around 8. This gives me four hours to myself and the gloomy view, I don't feel any emotion too severely at this time. Just me and the gloomy view. ",7
59,I think the job interview went okay but I could have done better. I stumbled over some questions but at the same time I answered most of their questions well. There will always be other opportunities for me as well. I've just got to keep my head up and keep at it.,6
60,Today I need to get all of my chores done. I plan on picking up my husband from work and may end up getting groceries on the way home. If he is hungry we will stop at chic-fil-a. ,5
61,I am visiting family today. We will be making lots of food. We will be watching movies.,8
62,I woke up this morning feeling sick. I will take over the counter meds. I will drink plenty of fluids and rest. I will make a doctor appointment if it gets worse. ,5
63,I had a lot of ups and downs this year but i survived.,5
64,"Well, it's been a hell of a year and I am expected to work until 5 PM today. My bosses are asses when it comes to holidays. Year before last, I worked my ass off to prepare my place to receive a renter, moving everything I had in my bedroom out, creating a studio for myself, and finding a part time job outside my home, to supplement my disability income. Then the pandemic hit, and everything I did went out the window. I had to rethink everything, go back to the drawing board and started working full time, despite having multiple chronic conditions and turning age 65 this year. Frankly, I feel like I have lived the hardest life a person could live, and that I am destined to spend the rest of my life in servitude, alone like a dog. ",3
65,"In August, my wife and I had to leave her parents' home where we had been staying. We had high hopes of saving up for a vehicle and starting to travel. Because we work remotely, we can do our work on the road or from anywhere we like. But in five months, we have not yet been able to save up for a car. The only ""traveling"" we have done is back and forth to Wal-Mart or to get food. The only sights we have seen is the interior of our crappy hotel room. I am not sure we will ever be able to get ahead enough to purchase a vehicle and start traveling as we intended.",2
66,"Today I have to start work early, but I'll be able to watch the sun come up! I hope the meeting goes well - we've been having some problems with [REDACTED] lately, it's like they are trying to let stuff fall through the cracks and we don't have time to go back and fix everything right now when the event is in one week. I also don't like how they stick their fingers in everyone else's business and say they're going to take care of things and then just ""forget"". If they would just relinquish some control, I think everyone would be in a better position.",2
67,"Finals week was pretty bad. While I felt confident on my first exam, the second exam made me feel like I’ve learned nothing during the course. I somehow still managed an A- in the class, but my expectations were much lower, and I hate thinking that I did poorly when I studied a ton. The rest of that week I felt like I did nothing. I was basically in a depressive state when I just watched tv and didn’t really get anything accomplished. I really don’t want to feel like that ever again.",2
68,"I found out today that my Grandpa tested positive for COVID. I feel sick to my stomach, because I don't know if he'll be able to handle it. I keep hoping that he won't have it bad, but he is so at risk to have a serious case. I wish I lived closer, but I guess that wouldn't even really do anything, because I still wouldn't be able to see him. I don't even know how to reach out to him about it, because it wasn't my grandpa and grandma who told me, and they don't know that I know. ",2
69,"2020 sucked. I couldn't travel at all, which is something I had looked forward to throughout the last 3 years of college. I told myself that when I got into med school and graduated college, I would travel the world. Because of COVID, I didn't get to do that. I also couldn't get the watch I wanted for graduation because COVID reduced production of a lot of luxury goods. I also dislike online learning and virtual school. This year was terrible.",2
70,"It is only downhill from here.  I lost a year in the prime of my life to this pandemic and I am probably going to lose more than that.  Even if I usually travel or go out often, I missed out on all the opportunities that would have been there this year.  As I get older everything will just start to pass me by and soon I will be stuck at home as my friends all get married and move on with their lives.",3
71,"Things have really been awful lately. It seems like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Things tend to come in waves, good and bad. I'm dealing with the bad right now. I got hit pretty hard financially and right now that's one of the worst things that could happen. I like to try to see the light at the end of the tunnel but there isn't much light to look for right now. ",2
72,"If I continue to let my anxiety control how I feel about life, 2021 will not be a great one for me. Any and everything can go wrong when it comes to my goals. Life is very unpredictable and you can never prepare for the worst to happen. My biggest fear is that I do not become financial stable and I have to live paycheck to paycheck. I am also afraid of contracting COVID-19. ",5
73,"I ate a ton of food and now I feel really bloated and fat. I looked in the mirror and I can see that my stomach is so much fatter than before. I weighed myself and I'm about 10 pounds heavier as well. I really should exercise more. If I don't, say goodbye to getting a girlfriend. Nobody is ever gonna love a fat guy unless they're rich. And I am definitely not rich. ",5
74,sothings i hate when people do talk with there mouth full. some things we should not do i also do like people talking back to odler peopl i have learned in my life. working at work sucks i hate the long hours and i hate the people i work with i just want to stay home. i would wake up and think to my self ugs why do i have to go in for one more day at work.,1
75,"I have had a nasty day today, I woke up tired. I then went out to get a cup of disappointing coffee, everything is going to be bad. I have some important tasks to get done soon, they probably won't they all go well. I still haven't heard back from some opportunities, I'm sure they won't reach back. Everything is terrible.",2
76,"I had trouble starting up my car today. It sputters and I have to push the ON button multiple times before it finally starts. To make matters worse, the right headlight went out too. Its probably because I hit that huge pothole on the new route I was trying on the way home. Not looking forward to that repair bill ",2
77,"Last night at the party, I went to the bathroom twice to vomit. However, not much came out of my system although I tried my best to force it out. After a little came out, I felt a little better and was able to comfortably go to sleep. I woke up a little late and signed onto work a little late because of it. ",3
78,"I feel extremely tired. I did not get a lick of sleep last night and I just want to pass out for the next 6 hours. I also thing my mother is judging me for staying up late as well as gaining weight recently so I've not been feeling the best mentally. I hope that the day gets better, kinda sucks right now. ",1
79,"Life is shit. What is the point of trying when it will all fall apart anyway. I don't believe that anything positive will come out of all the effort i put in. Why bother trying when the outcome will always be negative, at the end of the day I am still the same crappy person that can't accomplish anything.",0
80,I am frustated with how things have been going. I am having a hard time affording food and earning money. I have lost so much work and it is driving me crazy. I am hungry for so much more out of life. I don't know what to expect next. Life is so scary right now. I just want to feel secure and content.,1
81,"I just feel so...stuck. Lost and confused. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel like I've lost everything close to me and I don't know how to find solace in anything anymore. I wish I could open up and talk about my feelings to someone but even if I could trust anyone, I just don't know how. ",2
82," I dont feel that anything is going to change. My board exam is hanging over my head and I feel that there is no chance of me passing. This virus will never end, so many people do not wear masks and put others at risk. Everyone is in for alot more hardships. The future does not look bright. ",1
83,This winter has been especially tough with social distancing. Staying in one place all day every day has made it tough to enjoy this time of year. Plus the cold makes it miserable and my allergies really act up with the heat being turned on. I'm not sure when winter is ever going to end.,2
84,This day couldn't get much worse.  I'm done working already so I have the rest of the day with nothing to do.  I'm already so bored! Why does my life have to suck so much. I wish I could find a job where I could make more money and not have so much free time on my hands.,1
85,I had a terrible day at work today and I ended up messing a few orders. I had no energy at all and it was miserable outside all day. I went for a walk but ended up spraining my ankle. I ended up eating a small meal for dinner and it gave me a stomach ache. ,1
86,I am worried we are not doing enough fast enough regarding the pandemic. Some people still do not wear masks or social distance. It could be up to 6 months before I am immunized. I worry I may get Co-vid before I can get vaccinated.,1
87,"Last night was a terrible night for me. I basically had a panic attack in the restroom. I was scared that people could hear me, I was sure they could hear me. So I was trying to be quiet, quiet breathing quiet panicking.",4
88,That job interview was terrible. I shouldn't have even bothered to go in. I am so under qualified for the position. This was the only thing I had lined up what am I supposed to do now. ,2
89,I feel like we can never get ahead financially. All we have to look forward to is more debt. I don't think things will ever get better. I really wish I could have a different life. ,0
90,There is a new strain of COvid as the new year rolls around. The weather is getting colder and getting out is getting harder. ,6
91,I woke up this morning feeling sick. I feel rotten! I don’t have time for this! How long is this going to last? This sucks!,1
92,This is as bad as life can get. I've lost so much. I cant ever get past this.,0
